## About
[[back to top]](#leetcode-screenshotter--)

This project uses selenium to programmatically screenshot all editorials and problems.

Please report any [Issues](https://github.com/akhilkammila/leetcode-screenshotter/issues), such as
* Blurry images
* Improperly cropped images
* Problems that I skipped over

Potential future improvements for the project include:
* Screenshot the starting code for premium problems
* Screenshot the editorials for multiple languages (C++, Java, Python) instead of just the default of C++
* Make sure that the code in the editorials is fully shown (sometimes it is hidden by scroll)
* Regular updates to include new problems

I am done working on the project for now, but if this becomes popular and people start using it, I may do more. If you want a feature, open an Issue, and I may do it. Please reach out if you are interested in contributing.
