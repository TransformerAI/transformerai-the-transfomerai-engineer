## How to contribute?

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Project Issues](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/issues).
* Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned" to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise
  for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request, and it will be evaluated by project
  maintainers.
* If you are unable to find an open issue referring to the same problem, depending on the type of issue follow the
  appropriate steps:

#### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

- Please read the documentation in
  here [Contributing to the Documentation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
  [open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/issues/new), make changes and then create a pull
  request, it will be put under review and accepted if it is appropriate.

#### Do you want to add a new feature?

* [Open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and a clear
  description** and a **test case** demonstrating the new feature that you want to add to the project.

##### Contributing to Algorithms (Make sure to check all the points below before opening a PR)

* Make sure you follow proper coding standards and naming conventions.
    * Please
      use [Binary Search Implementation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/Search/BinarySearch.scala)
    *
  and [Binary Search Test](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/src/test/scala/Search/BinarySearchSpec.scala)
  as a reference.
* Add the algorithm implementation as an object and not as a class
* Add proper comments about the algorithm implementation and the functions present in the algorithm
* Add a test spec in the test folder under the same domain as that of your algorithm. **PRs without a test spec would
  not be accepted!**
* Add at least 1 positive and 1 negative test in the test spec
* Raise a PR for the algorithm object file and the test spec
* [How to write a test case in Scala](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/writing_your_first_test)

#### Contributing to Tests

* You can contribute tests for a specific algorithm
* Add as many tests as you can and try to cover all the borderline test cases
* Open a PR with for your testSpec
* Make sure you are not adding redundant test cases
* If you see that the algorithm fails for a particular test case, then open an issue with proper explanation.
* [How to write a test case in Scala](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/writing_your_first_test)

#### Do you want to fix a bug?

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/issues/new).Be sure to include a **title and a clear
  description** and a **test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the repository in
  the [TheAlgorithms room in GITTER](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) or
  [open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/issues/new)
